# CSE-316-Assignment
Question.1 (Uses Round Robin Algorithm)
Sudesh Sharma is a Linux expert who wants to have an online system where he can handle student queries. Since there can be multiple requests at any time he wishes to dedicate a fixed amount of time to every request so that everyone gets a fair share of his time. He will log into the system from 10am to 12am only.  He wants to have separate requests queues for students and faculty. Implement a strategy for the same. The summary at the end of the session should include the total time he spent on handling queries and average query time. 

Question.2 (Uses C Look Agorithm) 
C program to solve the following problem: Suppose that a disk drive has 5,000 cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder143, and the previous request was at cylinder 125. The queue of pending requests in FIFO order is: 86, 1470, 913, 1774, 948, 1509, 1022, 1750, 130 Starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in cylinders)that the disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending requests for each of the C-LOOK disk-scheduling algorithms?
